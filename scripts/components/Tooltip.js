Welcome, brave leader! In Super Exomine, you will lead your colonies and facilities in harvesting minerals to thrive while fending off the nefarious Pirate Captain and their raiders. Here's what you need to know for success:<br><br>

1. Select governors and facilities to harvest minerals for your colonies. Switch these at anytime!<br><br>

2. Minerals have different values and all of them can be used to conduct purchases, but Xenite is vital for your colonies' survival. Each turn your colonies will consume Xenite to power thier life-support. Don't run out!<br><br>

3. Beware! After each turn, pirates have a chance to raid your colonies and faciliites at random! Ensure you have enough security at each location to defend against them. If you have less security than the pirates have raiders, they will steal your minerals. Security and raiders are reduced after each raid, regardless of success.<br><br>

4. Raiders increase each turn. Brace yourself for the escalating pirate threats!<br><br>

5. Governors are crucial leaders. There is a chance that the pirates may kill a colony's leader during a raid. If this happens, make sure to recruit a new one.<br><br>

6. Turns progress anytime minerals are harvested, security is purchased, or a governor is recruited. Make strategic choices!<br><br>

7. The game ends if all your governors perish or the colonies run out of Xenite. Stay vigilant!<br><br>

Lead your colonies to prosperity, hold off the pirates, and conquer Super Exomine!</div>`
